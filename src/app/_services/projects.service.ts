Initially a passion project, it caught the attention of my professor, leading to its official integration into the universityâ€™s computer science website where I committed over 5000 lines of code. I led a team of four in a larger group of ten to design and implement the room reservation feature. You can check out the app here: <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/welcome" target="_blank"> https://csxl.unc.edu/welcome</a>.
